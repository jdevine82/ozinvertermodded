# ozinvertermodded
This git is an opensource project. The orginal design comes from a bloke on Finders Island going by the handle of OZTULES.
He has given the design to the public domain. I have simply penned the schematic down by reverse engineering his PCB as this was not 
written down anywhere. The files here contain the basic version and also a version coming with switchmode regulators. Free for anyone to use.
4/09/16 reworked with switchmode ps for 48-12v conversion. Changed pcb to 10x10. Use this type of regulator http://www.ebay.com.au/itm/DC-DC-Converter-4-5-60V-Adjustable-Step-Down-Buck-LM2596HV-Power-Supply-Module-/261942503087?hash=item3cfcfd66af:g:pZwAAOSw-7RVE8oj
